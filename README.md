# Algorithms
The idea of this repository is to keep safe my studies about algorithms and programming languages.

## [The Elevator Algorithm](https://github.com/Lucasosf/algorithms/tree/master/elevator)

Is lunch time, then you have to get peaple to ground floor quickly.

Data volume:
 - 14 floors
 - 30 people per floor weighing 80kg each one
 - 4 elavators
 - there is stairs
 - the elevator supports up to 800 kg

Let the games begin.

## [The Fibonacci Algorithm](https://github.com/Lucasosf/algorithms/tree/master/fibonacci)

Based on [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number), this algo must to generate a serie of numbers like this:

```ruby
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...]
```

## [The Hello World Algorithm](https://github.com/Lucasosf/algorithms/tree/master/hello_world)

The beginning of this series of challenges is to make an program that
show the message "Hello World!" as default, but the programmer can use
the same code to write direct messages like "Hello Lucas!"
