The idea of this repository is to keep safe my studies about algorithms
in diferents languages.

## The Elevator Algorithm

Is lunch time, then you have to get peaple to ground floor quickly.

Data volume:
 - 14 floors
 - more then 1 elevator fully of peaple per floor
 - 4 elavators
 - there is stairs
 - the elevator has the technology that you want

Let the games begin.

Check the results for:
 - Ruby
 - Elixir
 - Javascript
 - C++
 - Python
 - C#
