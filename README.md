# Algorithms
The idea of this repository is to keep safe my studies about algorithms
in diferents languages.

## The Elevator Algorithm

Is lunch time, then you have to get peaple to ground floor quickly.

Data volume:
 - 14 floors
 - more then 1 elevator fully of peaple per floor
 - 4 elavators
 - there is stairs
 - the elevator has the technology that you want

Let the games begin.

## The Hello World Algorithm

The beginning of this series of challenges is to make an program that
show the message "Hello World!" as default, but the programmer can use
the same code to write direct messages like "Hello Lucas!"
